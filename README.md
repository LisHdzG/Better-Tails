# 🚀 Agora: Meaningful Connections, Reimagined.

## 💡 The Problem

In-person networking is often a challenge:

- **Unstructured:** People meet at events but rarely exchange contact information properly.  
- **Easy to Lose:** Contacts end up scattered across photos, notes, or forgotten apps.  
- **Not Memorable:** It’s easy to forget who you met, where, and why.

**Our Challenge:** Create a modern, fluid solution that transforms real-life encounters into lasting, organized digital connections.

## ✨ The Agora Solution

Agora is the elegant, lightweight platform designed to enhance real-world networking through three core pillars:

---

### 1. Instant QR-Based Connections

Agora focuses on capturing the moment when people actually meet.

We remove friction by allowing users to connect simply by scanning a personalized QR code—no typing, no searching, no awkward exchanges.

#### Key Connection Features:
- **Dynamic QR Generator:** Each user has a clean, scannable identity code.  
- **Instant QR Scanner:** Add a new connection in seconds.  
- **Connection History:** All encounters are saved and accessible at any time.

### 2. Simple & Clean User Profiles

Agora provides each user with a minimal identity card that reflects who they are at a glance.

#### Key Profile Features:
- **Lightweight user profile** with essential information.  
- **Editable fields with live preview.**  
- **Glassmorphism design:** Blur-based UI for a modern, premium look.

### 3. Smooth, Modern User Experience

A huge part of this project was mastering fluid UI design, motion, and interaction patterns.

#### Key Experience Features:
- **Advanced SwiftUI animations** to create a dynamic interface.  
- **Natural transitions** for intuitive navigation.  
- **Glassmorphism components** that enhance depth and clarity.  
- **Micro-interactions** that make the app feel alive.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

| Category | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Language** | Swift 5.9+ |
| **Frameworks** | SwiftUI, AVFoundation (QR Scanning), CoreImage |
| **Architecture** | MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) |
| **Platform** | iOS 17.0+ |

**Key Structure Insight:**  
The modular use of ViewModels (`ProfileViewModel`, `QRViewModel`, `ConnectionsViewModel`) ensures that business logic stays clean, separated, and scalable.

## 🎯 Final Purpose

Agora is not a clone — it is a **reinterpretation** of an existing App Store concept, built to learn:

- Smooth UI patterns  
- Advanced animations  
- Glassmorphism layouts  
- QR-based identity exchange  
- Scalable MVVM architecture  

A personal exploration transformed into a functional, modern networking tool.
