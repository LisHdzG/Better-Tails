# üêæ Better Tails: Adopci√≥n Responsable, Simplificada.

## üí° The Problem

The traditional pet adoption process is often a barrier:

* **Confusing:** Adopters are unsure of the commitment and logistics.
* **Inefficient:** Shelters lack the digital tools for effective matching and communication.
* **Uncertain:** The lack of support leads to higher rates of returned pets.

**Our Challenge:** Create a tech solution that simplifies the adoption journey while enforcing responsibility, building lasting connections between pets and their future families.
